# Heft

Heft is a programming language for programming with Higher order EFfecTs.

Currently, we have implemented a parser and an interpreter for the basic languge.
We plan on extending it with a pretty-printer and type checker, and we plan to add more features to the language.

## Running the examples

```
$ cabal run heft -- examples/Fib.heft
```
